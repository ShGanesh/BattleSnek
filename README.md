# BattleSnek
[Battlesnake](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api) is a multi-player programming game played by developers all over the world. This is my attempt at a basic implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api).   
Battlesnake a great starting point for anyone wanting to program their first Battlesnake using Python. It comes ready to use with [Repl.it](https://repl.it) and provides instructions below for getting started. It can also be deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com), or any other cloud provider you'd like.

### Technologies Used  
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/)  

### Running on Repl.it  
Please visit my [Replit link](https://replit.com/@SharenGanesh029/starter-snek-python#server.py)

### Basic Development Goals   
Here are some basic dev goals by the official Battlesnake people.  
- [x] Avoid colliding with walls
- [x] Avoid colliding with yourself
- [ ] Try to move towards food
- [ ] Avoid colliding with other snakes  

### Trivia   
- Competition against live Battlesnakes, further exploration and implementation of more complex strategies will be done once these basic goals have been fulfilled.
