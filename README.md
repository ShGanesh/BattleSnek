### Running on Repl.it  
Please visit the [Replit link](https://replit.com/@SharenGanesh029/starter-snek-python-1#server.py)

### Basic Development Goals   
Here are some basic dev goals by the official Battlesnake people.  
- [x] Avoid colliding with walls
- [ ] Avoid colliding with yourself
- [ ] Try to move towards food

Competetion against live Battlesnakes, further exploration and implementation of more complex strategies will be done once these basic goals have been fulfilled.
