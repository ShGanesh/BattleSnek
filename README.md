### Basic Development Goals  
Here are some basic dev goals by the official Battlesnake people.  
- [ ] Avoid colliding with walls
- [ ] Avoid colliding with yourself
- [ ] Try to move towards food
- [ ] Avoid colliding with other snakes

Competetion against live Battlesnakes, further exploration and implementation of more complex strategies will be done once these basic goals have been fulfilled.
